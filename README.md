### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm really passionate about Machine Learning and Data Science. With the development of technology, I believe that there is a huge potential for Artificial Intelligence in different domains. The rapid rate at which there is advancement in Computing power and the freedom to take a large amount of data really pushes the field of Data Science and Machine Learning to a whole new level. 

It is with my interest and passion towards the field that I started to apply my knowledge of Machine Learning in different projects. I've gone through some of the courses that are in demand in the field of Machine Learning such as "Machine Learning" and "Deep Learning Specialization" both by Andrew Ng. Below are the links to some of my projects on Data Science. Some of the projects present involve performing data analysis and data visualization which are important to get insights. 

ðŸ”­ I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Some of them involve Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. 

ðŸŒ± Below are the links to my projects on GitHub. 

Since Machine Learning is a diverse field where the algorithms could be applied in different areas, I have created sections for projects depending on their application and their area.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects

There is a huge amount of text generated every second. It is important to use the text and get an understanding of it. Text could be in the form of articles, news, street signs and textbooks. I've worked with Natural Language Processing and below are some of the projects along with their brief description.
