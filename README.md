### Hi there 👋

I'm really passionate about Machine Learning and Data Science. With the development of technology, I believe that there is a huge potential for Artificial Intelligence in different domains. The rapid rate at which there is advancement in Computing power and the freedom to take a large amount of data really pushes the field of Data Science and Machine Learning to a whole new level. 

It is with my interest and passion towards the field that I started to apply my knowledge of Machine Learning in different projects. I've gone through some of the courses that are in demand in the field of Machine Learning such as "Machine Learning" and "Deep Learning Specialization" both by Andrew Ng. Below are the links to some of my projects on Data Science. Some of the projects present involve performing data analysis and data visualization which are important to get insights. 

🔭 I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Some of them involve Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. 

🌱 Below are the links to my projects on GitHub. 

## Machine Learning Projects 

&emsp;&emsp; [🚴‍♂️Washington Bike Demand Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Washington-Bike-Demand-Prediction) - In this project, the demand for rental bikes was predicted using different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Moreover, some of the useful features were visualized. Dependencies between features were highlighted and correlation matrix was plotted to get an understanding of the relationship betweep features.;
