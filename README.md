## ü™öüîß My Skills üòÄüòÄ: 

I've learned coding right from a young age. I learned "C" language and then now learning python which really gave me an edge for learning machine learning and data science. I was able to learn and understand the code well. Later, I also learned various other programming languages such as "R" which were really important in order to become a machine learning engineer or a data scientist. Below are the list of some of my skills that I've gained throughout my experience of working with data science and machine learning. Learning these important tools and techniques really helped me accelerate the machine learning projects and understand their working in full detail. Feel free to take a look.

## üìîüììMy InspirationüòÄüòÄ:

![](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/kristopher-roller-PC_lbSSxCZE-unsplash.jpg)
My interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence started when I was in my final year pursuing a Bachelor of Technology. I remember that we had to pick a final year project. During that time, I could see that machine learning and artificial intelligence were talked about most on the internet, and it's potential to revolutionize people's lives. I suggested to my teammates that using machine learning for healthcare is a really good practice. Me and my teammates worked using Machine Learning to predict the chances of a person to suffer from Heart Disease respectively. The challenge with diagnosing whether a person would suffer from heart disease using traditional methods is that they are often slow and require a lot of time and effort from the doctors. Therefore, we looked for various ways in which we would automate the process. We were able to download the dataset from Kaggle and implement the machine learning models for predictions for the heart disease dataset. We were able to get good results on the test set. I could see how machine learning was used for diagnosing whether a person would suffer from heart disease. It spiked an interest where I tried to look for ways in which I could apply machine learning. I came across Kaggle - a website that allows people to download datasets for machine learning and artificial intelligence purposes. I applied my knowledge of machine learning and data science in different domains such as healthcare, academia, and retail industriesüòÄüòÄ.

It is with my interest and passion for the field that I started to apply my knowledge of Machine Learning in different projects. I've gone through some of the courses that are in demand in the field of Machine Learning such as "Machine Learning" and "Deep Learning Specialization" both by Andrew Ng. Below are the links to some of my projects on Data Science. Some of the projects present involve performing data analysis and data visualization which are important to get insights.

üìù Furthermore, I also write articles and share my blogs through Medium. It is a website where writers could share their thoughts with the community through publications. I've written articles on Machine Learning and Data Science. Below is the link to my Medium articles.
https://suhas-maddali007.medium.com

üî≠ I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Some of them involve Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes.
 
## ü§ñ‚öôÔ∏è My Machine Learning Projects 

<img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/GIF-files/blob/main/machine%20learning%20gif%20file.gif" width = "750"/>

In this section, different sets of machine learning projects are highlighted. Feel free to click on the links for the projects that are highlighted. There is a brief description of the projects along with useful definitions. In the next few sections, a subset of Artificial Intelligence such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) would be covered along with Data Visualization.

&emsp;&emsp; [üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWashington Bike Demand Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Washington-Bike-Demand-Prediction) - In this project, the demand for rental bikes was predicted using different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Moreover, some of the useful features were visualized. Dependencies between features were highlighted and a correlation matrix was plotted to get an understanding of the relationship between features. After that, machine learning predictions were performed to ensure that we are getting the output for the test set respectively. 

&emsp;&emsp; [üöôCar Prices Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Car-Prices-Prediction) - In this machine learning project, the prices of cars would be predicted based on features such as horsepower (HP), Mileage, Make, and other features. Most of the project contains visualizations followed by machine learning and deep learning algorithm predictions.

&emsp;&emsp; [üè¶Predicting Loan Default Using Machine Learning*](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Predicting-Loan-Default-Using-Machine-Learning) - It is important for banks to give loans to customers based on their ability to pay back a loan. Sometimes, banks end up giving loans to people and not getting paid back the money along with interest. Machine Learning could be used in order to determine whether a loan must be given to a person, and this would help the financial institutions and banks to save money respectively. In the project, various features such as income levels and the amount of loan taken were considered as features for predicting whether a person would be paying back a loan or not. Since the data that was taken contained a lot of NULL values, various imputation methods were followed such as mean, median, and mode imputation.

<img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/olav-ahrens-rotne-MAEbdaFe4ps-unsplash.jpg" width = "750"/>

Machine learning is used in many industries and there is a lot of demand and scope for it. There are so many tools and resources that one could be used in order to become a machine learning engineer. However, there are certain challenges in machine learning that must be addressed before they could be used for machine learning analysis. 

1. __Availability of data__ - Getting access to quality data is important for machine learning predictions. Sometimes, companies cannot have access to a large volume of data that could be used for machine learning purposes. Moreover, the data that is available might not give a very good prediction accuracy and might not be quite useful for the machine learning predictions at hand. 

2. __Infrastructure Requirements__ - There is also a possibility for the companies particularly startups to have the infrastructure needed for the machine learning processes respectively. They might be used some third-party applications such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order for them to perform their day-to-day predictions using ML algorithms. However, this would lead to further questions such as security and data ownership. 

3. __Rigid Business models__ - Companies need to be flexible where they must spend their time to other resources apart from the fixed number of resources for them to work effectively. There are many companies that might require deep learning models to be more flexible and more useful and robust. When we are implementing the machine learning models, there could be instances where we might have to fix our approach rather than be more flexible. This creates problems for large-scale businesses as they must adapt to the market as and when needed. Therefore, steps must be taken to make the models more flexible and easy to understand. 

4. __Lack of Talent__ - Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist are some of the talked about professions in the IT industry. There are many universities and colleges making use of artificial intelligence programs so that they could meet the demand from the tech industry. However, there still seems to be a lot of gaps in the industry. More and more courses and online learning resources should be created so that more people can enter the field of data science and machine learning.
