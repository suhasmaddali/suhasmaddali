## 📔📓My Inspiration😀😀:

![](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/kristopher-roller-PC_lbSSxCZE-unsplash.jpg)
My interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence started when I was in my final year pursuing a Bachelor of Technology. I remember that we had to pick a final year project. During that time, I could see that machine learning and artificial intelligence were talked about most on the internet, and it's potential to revolutionize people's lives. I suggested to my teammates that using machine learning for healthcare is a really good practice. Me and my teammates worked using Machine Learning to predict the chances of a person to suffer from Heart Disease respectively. The challenge with diagnosing whether a person would suffer from heart disease using traditional methods is that they are often slow and require a lot of time and effort from the doctors. Therefore, we looked for various ways in which we would automate the process. We were able to download the dataset from Kaggle and implement the machine learning models for predictions for the heart disease dataset. We were able to get good results on the test set. I could see how machine learning was used for diagnosing whether a person would suffer from heart disease. It spiked an interest where I tried to look for ways in which I could apply machine learning. I came across Kaggle - a website that allows people to download datasets for machine learning and artificial intelligence purposes. I applied my knowledge of machine learning and data science in different domains such as healthcare, academia, and retail industries😀😀.

## My Computer Vision Projects

![](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/GIF-files/blob/main/Robot%20Computer%20Vision.gif)

Computer Vision is a subset of artificial intelligence which gives the computer to perform computations and make predictions on image data. If the image of a cat is given, for instance, the computer vision algorithms would classify whether there is a cat in the image based on a previously labeled set of images. Therefore, it is important to give the right data to the computer vision algorithms in order for them to get the right predictions. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🥄Steel Defect Detection](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Steel-Defect-Detection-Challenge) - There are many steel manufacturing industries that produce large quantities of steel. There might be instances where there are defects that go unnoticed. These defects can lead to a reduction in the quality of steel respectively. Moreover, This could lead to problems such as corrosion and other errors. Since it takes a lot of time for people to detect the defects in steel, proper analysis and prediction mechanisms must be undertaken. Predictions can be generated by the Convoluted Neural Networks (CNNs) based on the past training examples. Therefore, this would save a lot of time and effort by companies when they deploy machine learning models in predicting the damage present in the steel. We would use deep learning models in predicting the defects in steel respectively.

There are different kernel sizes considered and outputs are noted using a graph respectively. By doing this project, I've learned to use Keras and Tensorflow for building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) respectively.

## My Data Visualization Projects 
It is important to note that data visualization is the key to extract insights from the data. In addition to this, it also gives us insights into whether new features must be created or removed. If we find that there is a strong correlation between different features, all those features can be removed (considering that the dimensionality of the data is very large). Therefore, we have to spend time in performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Below are some of the data visualization projects.

&emsp;&emsp; [📽YouTube Video Analysis](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis) - Since there are many videos being uploaded every day, it is important to analyze the videos and the categories.

📃 [In Machine Learning, Correlation might not always be equal to Causation](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/in-machine-learning-correlation-might-not-always-be-equal-to-causation-ed81f2e4c3d3) - When taking into account visualizations from different features in our data, we could sometimes assume that correlated features are dependent on each other and occurrence of one feature might lead to the occurrence of the other. However, this might not always be true when performing the visualizations. In the blog, I’ve written examples and illustrations where correlation might not always be equal to causation and explained the details. 

📃 [Predicting the Sentiment of a text using Machine Learning](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/predicting-the-sentiment-of-a-text-with-machine-learning-3130c2685a97) - There is an abundance of text around us. Since text is in the string format when talking in terms of computer context, it is important that steps are taken to convert it into a form that could be used for machine learning purposes. We use various natural language processing techniques for the process of converting the raw text into a form that is easily feasible for the machine learning algorithms. In the medium article, I’ve mentioned some of the latest natural language processing techniques. Feel free to have a look! 

📃 [Why is GPT-3 revolutionizing the Natural Language Processing Industry (NLP)?](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/why-is-gpt-3-revolutionizing-the-natural-language-processing-industry-nlp-9aecbac149ad) - Text is available in many forms such as in books, articles, magazines, and publications. It would be really wise to make use of the text that is present in industries. We've seen how Facebook has released the GPT algorithm that would take the text and understand the context, making it's predictions in the future. In the medium article, I've mentioned the use of GPT by giving numerous examples of it's working respectively. Feel free to share your thoughts from the article. Thanks! 

📃 [How to understand Machine Learning?](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/how-to-understand-machine-learning-237492943525) - In this article, I discuss various courses that teach machine learning such as courses by [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) and [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/). Moreover, various steps are mentioned about the proper use of these courses to gain a good understanding of machine learning algorithms. It is important to learn the right courses before diving into the machine learning projects. Having a good theoretical knowledge of machine learning models and optimization techniques ensure that one gets a firm understanding of the practical implementation of models. 

📃 [Introduction to Natural Language Processing for Machine Learning](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/introduction-to-natural-language-processing-for-machine-learning-ec748131d213) - There is abundance of text present in magazines, newspapers, articles and blogs. In order to use the natural text, conversion mechanisms must be followed which would ensure that we get the best results when performing machine learning analysis. In the article, I've mentioned various natural language processing steps and ways to process a raw text and convert it to a form that could be used for machine learning purposes. Feel free to take a look!
