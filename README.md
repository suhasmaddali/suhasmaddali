![](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/kristopher-roller-PC_lbSSxCZE-unsplash.jpg)
My interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence started when I was in my final year pursuing Bachelor of Technology. I remember that we had to pick a final year project. During that time, I could see that machine learning and artificial intelligence were talked about mostly on the internet, and it's potential to revolutionize people's lives. I suggested my teammates that using machine learning for healthcare is a really good practice. Me and my teammates worked with using Machine Learning to predict the chances of a person to suffer from a Heart Disease respectively. The challenge with diagnosing whether a person would suffer from a heart disease using traditional methods are that they are often slow and require a lot of time and effort by the doctors. Therefore, we looked for various ways at which we would automate the process. We were able to download dataset from Kaggle and implement the machine learning models for predictions for heart disease dataset. We were able to get good results on the test set. I could see how machine learning was used for diagnosing whether a person would suffer from a heart disease. It spiked an interest where I tried to look for ways at which I could apply machine learning. I came across Kaggle - a website that allows people to download datasets for machine learning and artificial intelligence purposes. I applied my knowledge of machine learning and data science in different domains such as healthcare, academia and retail industries😀😀.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand various important features in the data. The notebooks have been split where one is for EDA while the other is for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Predictions respectively. 

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is converting a natural text into a form that could be used for machine learning and deep learning purposes. It involves extracting texts, removing stopwords, lemmatization and stemming, lowercasing the letters and removing punctuations and other text information that do not add a lot of meaning in our machine learning predictions. Below are the links to some of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.

In addition to this, understanding the difficulty of text and whether it is in our level could give us a good knowledge about the depth of the article. Moreover, libraries and other educational institutions could use this information and classify textbooks and notebooks, and seperate them based on the difficulty level. In this project, machine learning and deep learning algorithms were used to predict the difficulty of texts. Hyperparameter tuning was also done to ensure that the models took important features into consideration and made predictions with low mean squared error and mean absolute error respectively. 

&emsp;&emsp; [👹Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis) - In Twitter, there are comments made for different posts and tweets.

## Computer Vision Projects 
Computer Vision is a subset of artificial intelligence which gives the computer to perform computations and make predictions on image data. If image of a cat is given, for instance, the computer vision algorithms would classify whether there is cat in the image based on previous labelled set of images. Therefore, it is important to give the right data to the computer vision algorithms in order for them to get the right predictions. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🥄Steel Defect Detection](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Steel-Defect-Detection-Challenge) - There are many steel manufacturing industries that produce large quantities of steel. There might be instances where there are defects that go unnoticed. These defects can lead to reduction in the quality of steel respectively. Moreover, This could lead to problems such as corrosion and other errors. Since it takes a lot of time for people to detect the defects in steel, proper analysis and prediction mechanisms must be undertaken. Predictions can be generated by the Convoluted Neural Networks (CNNs) based on the past training examples. Therefore, this would save a lot of time and effort by companies when they deploy machine learning models in predicting the damage present in steel. We would use deep learning models in predicting the defects in steel respectively.

&emsp;&emsp; [🕸Convoluted Neural Networks CNN Implementation Using Keras](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Convoluted-Neural-Networks-CNN-Implementation-Using-Keras) - This is a simple project to implement Convolutional Neural Network and note its working. Different layer sizes and different kernels are chosen and trained on a simple dataset. The data that was taken was MNIST that is available in Kaggle. There are different kernel sizes considered and outputs are noted using a graph respectively. By doing this project, I've learned to use Keras and Tensorflow for building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) respectively. 

## Data Visualization Projects 
It is important to note that data visualization is the key to extract insights from the data. In addition to this, it also gives us insights about whether new features must be created or removed. If we find that there is a strong correlation between different features, all those features can be removed (considering that the dimensionality of the data is very large). Therefore, we have to spend time in performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Below are some of the data visualization projects. 

&emsp;&emsp; [📽YouTube Video Analysis](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis) - Since there are many videos being uploaded everyday, it is important to analyze the videos and the categories. In the project, we have also analyzed the likes, comments and other important features when videos are being uploaded. Various plots were used in the process of exploring the data such as Scatterplots and Countplots. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🔍Google Play store Genre Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Google-Play-Store-Genre-Prediction) - In this analysis, we are going to understand the different type of apps in Google Play store.
