### Hi there 👋

I'm really passionate about Machine Learning and Data Science. With the development of technology, I believe that there is a huge potential for Artificial Intelligence in different domains. The rapid rate at which there is advancement in Computing power and the freedom to take a large amount of data really pushes the field of Data Science and Machine Learning to a whole new level. 

It is with my interest and passion towards the field that I started to apply my knowledge of Machine Learning in different projects. I've gone through some of the courses that are in demand in the field of Machine Learning such as "Machine Learning" and "Deep Learning Specialization" both by Andrew Ng. Below are the links to some of my projects on Data Science. Some of the projects present involve performing data analysis and data visualization which are important to get insights.

📝 Furthermore, I also write articles and share my blogs through Medium. It is a website where writers could share their thoughts to the community through publications. I've written articles on Machine Learning and Data Science. Below is the link to my Medium articles.

🔭 I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Some of them involve Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. 

🌱 Below are the links to my projects on GitHub. 

## Machine Learning Projects 
In this section, different set of machine learning projects are highlighted. There is a brief description about the projects along with useful definitions. In the next few sections, subset of Artificial Intelligence such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) would be covered along with Data Visualization. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🚴‍♂️Washington Bike Demand Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Washington-Bike-Demand-Prediction) - In this project, the demand for rental             bikes was predicted using different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Moreover, some of the useful features were visualized. Dependencies between features were highlighted and correlation matrix was plotted to get an understanding of the relationship betweep features.

&emsp;&emsp; [🚙Car Prices Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Car-Prices-Prediction) - In this machine learning project, the prices of cars would be predicted based on features such as horsepower (HP), Mileage, Make and other features. Most of the project contains visualizations followed by machine learning and deep learning algorithm predictions. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🏦Predicting Loan Default Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Predicting-Loan-Default-Using-Machine-Learning) - It is important for banks to give loans to customers based on whether they would be able to repay the loan or not. Sometimes, banks end up giving loans to people and end up not getting paid back the money along with interest. Machine Learning could be used in order to determine whether loan must be given to a person, and this would help the financial institutions and banks in saving money respectively. 

&emsp;&emsp; [👨‍⚕️Cancer Diagnosis Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Cancer-Diagnosis-Prediction) - Cancer is a life-threatening disease, and it is really important to take the right steps in order to prevent this disease. Machine Learning and Data Science could be used to uncover key insights in data about Cancer and they could aid Doctors in predicting the chances of cancer. In this project, the chances of occurrence of cancer belonging to 9 classes is predicted using Machine Learning. Since there are more than 2 classes, it is a multi-class classification problem. 

&emsp;&emsp;[🧡Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Heart-Disease-Prediction) - There are features that are important to predict heart disease in a patient such as Blood Pressure (BP), BMI and other factors. Since doctors cannot take into account all the factors and suggest whether a person may or may not have a heart disease, it is time to use the machine learning and deep learning algorithms to the rescue. In this machine learning project, various features such as BMI, Cholestrol and other factors are considered for predicting the chances of a person to suffer from a heart disease. Various machine learning models were used for the predictions and their precision, recall and accuracy were plotted respectively. 

&emsp;&emsp; [⁉️Quora Question Pair Similarity](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Quora-Question-Pairs-Similarity) - In Quora, there are numerious questions being asked everyday during different instances of time. It is important for the company to determine whether the newly asked questions are similar to the ones that were asked before. This would save a lot of memory and resources on the part of Quora. With the aid of Machine Learning, it is possible to predict whether the newly asked questions are similar to the older ones. Once the predictions are performed, the answers to the previous questions are merged saving a lot of time and, memory and resources by the company. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🏄🧘🏻‍♀️Human Activity Detection](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis) - In some devices such as smartwatches and phones, there is a possibility to detect activity based on our hand movements and other important parameters. Taking into account different features for machine learning, we are going to be predicting the activity of human beings such as standing, walking or playing based on the hand movements. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand various important features in the data. The notebooks have been split where one is for EDA while the other is for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Predictions respectively. 

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is converting a natural text into a form that could be used for machine learning and deep learning purposes. It involves extracting texts, removing stopwords, lemmatization and stemming, lowercasing the letters and removing punctuations and other text information that do not add a lot of meaning in our machine learning predictions. Below are the links to some of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. 

&emsp;&emsp; [📚Predicting Readability of Texts Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Predicting-Readability-of-Texts-Using-Machine-Learning) - Since there is a lot of text around us, it would be beneficial if we get to know the content. In addition to this, understanding the difficulty of text and whether it is in our level could give us a good knowledge about the depth of the article. Moreover, libraries and other educational institutions could use this information and classify textbooks and notebooks, and seperate them based on the difficulty level. In this project, machine learning and deep learning algorithms were used to predict the difficulty of texts. Hyperparameter tuning was also done to ensure that the models took important features into consideration and made predictions with low mean squared error and mean absolute error respectively. 

&emsp;&emsp; [👹Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis) - In Twitter, there are comments made for different posts and tweets. Sometimes, there might be negative comments that would change the course of direction of certain topics. It is important to identify comments and extract key features from text so that positive and negative comments could be separated. In this project, we are going to be extracting useful information from texts and understand key components for differentiating between the positive texts and the negative texts.
