## Machine Learning Projects 
In this section, different set of machine learning projects are highlighted. There is a brief description about the projects along with useful definitions. In the next few sections, subset of Artificial Intelligence such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) would be covered along with Data Visualization. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🚴‍♂️Washington Bike Demand Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Washington-Bike-Demand-Prediction) - In this project, the demand for rental             bikes was predicted using different machine learning &emsp;&emsp;and deep learning algorithms. Moreover, some of the useful features were visualized. Dependencies between features &emsp;&emsp;were highlighted and correlation matrix was plotted to get an understanding of the relationship betweep features.

&emsp;&emsp; [🚙Car Prices Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Car-Prices-Prediction) - In this machine learning project, the prices of cars would be predicted based on features such as horsepower (HP), Mileage, Make and other features. Most of the project contains visualizations followed by machine learning and deep learning algorithm predictions. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🏦Predicting Loan Default Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Predicting-Loan-Default-Using-Machine-Learning) - It is important for banks to give loans to customers based on their ability to pay back a loan. Sometimes, banks end up giving loans to people and not getting paid back the money along with interest. Machine Learning could be used in order to determine whether loan must be given to a person, and this would help the financial institutions and banks to save money respectively. In the project, various features such as income levels and the amount of loan taken were considered as features for predicting whether a person would be paying back a loan or not. Since the data that was taken contained a lot of NULL values, various imputation methods were followed such as mean, median and mode imputation. 

&emsp;&emsp; [👨‍⚕️Cancer Diagnosis Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Cancer-Diagnosis-Prediction) - Cancer is a life-threatening disease, and it is really important to take the right steps in order to prevent this disease. Machine Learning and Data Science could be used to uncover key insights in data about Cancer and they could aid Doctors in predicting the chances of cancer. In this project, the chances of occurrence of cancer belonging to 9 classes is predicted using Machine Learning. Since there are more than 2 classes, it is a multi-class classification problem. 

&emsp;&emsp;[🧡Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Heart-Disease-Prediction) - There are features that are important to predict heart disease in a patient such as Blood Pressure (BP), BMI and other factors. Since doctors cannot take into account all the factors and suggest whether a person may or may not have a heart disease, it is time to use the machine learning and deep learning algorithms to the rescue. In this machine learning project, various features such as BMI, Cholestrol and other factors are considered for predicting the chances of a person to suffer from a heart disease. Various machine learning models were used for the predictions and their precision, recall and accuracy were plotted respectively. 

&emsp;&emsp; [⁉️Quora Question Pair Similarity](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Quora-Question-Pairs-Similarity) - In Quora, there are numerious questions being asked everyday during different instances of time. It is important for the company to determine whether the newly asked questions are similar to the ones that were asked before. This would save a lot of memory and resources on the part of Quora. With the aid of Machine Learning, it is possible to predict whether the newly asked questions are similar to the older ones. Once the predictions are performed, the answers to the previous questions are merged saving a lot of time and, memory and resources by the company. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🏄🧘🏻‍♀️Human Activity Detection](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition) - In some devices such as smart watches and phones, there is a possibility to detect activity based on our hand movements and other important parameters. Taking into account different features for machine learning, we are going to be predicting the activity of human beings such as standing, walking or playing based on the hand movements. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand various important features in the data. The notebooks have been split where one is for EDA while the other is for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Predictions respectively. 

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is converting a natural text into a form that could be used for machine learning and deep learning purposes. It involves extracting texts, removing stopwords, lemmatization and stemming, lowercasing the letters and removing punctuations and other text information that do not add a lot of meaning in our machine learning predictions. Below are the links to some of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. 

&emsp;&emsp; [📚Predicting Readability of Texts Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Predicting-Readability-of-Texts-Using-Machine-Learning) - Since there is a lot of text around us, it would be beneficial if we get to know the content. In addition to this, understanding the difficulty of text and whether it is in our level could give us a good knowledge about the depth of the article. Moreover, libraries and other educational institutions could use this information and classify textbooks and notebooks, and seperate them based on the difficulty level. In this project, machine learning and deep learning algorithms were used to predict the difficulty of texts. Hyperparameter tuning was also done to ensure that the models took important features into consideration and made predictions with low mean squared error and mean absolute error respectively. 

&emsp;&emsp; [👹Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis) - In Twitter, there are comments made for different posts and tweets. Sometimes, there might be negative comments that would change the course of direction of certain topics. It is important to identify comments and extract key features from text so that positive and negative comments could be separated. In this project, we are going to be extracting useful information from texts and understand key components for differentiating between the positive texts and the negative texts. 
   
## Computer Vision Projects 
Computer Vision is a subset of artificial intelligence which gives the computer to perform computations and make predictions on image data. If image of a cat is given, for instance, the computer vision algorithms would classify whether there is cat in the image based on previous labelled set of images. Therefore, it is important to give the right data to the computer vision algorithms in order for them to get the right predictions. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🥄Steel Defect Detection](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Steel-Defect-Detection-Challenge) - There are many steel manufacturing industries that produce large quantities of steel. There might be instances where there are defects that go unnoticed. These defects can lead to reduction in the quality of steel respectively. Moreover, This could lead to problems such as corrosion and other errors. Since it takes a lot of time for people to detect the defects in steel, proper analysis and prediction mechanisms must be undertaken. Predictions can be generated by the Convoluted Neural Networks (CNNs) based on the past training examples. Therefore, this would save a lot of time and effort by companies when they deploy machine learning models in predicting the damage present in steel. We would use deep learning models in predicting the defects in steel respectively.

&emsp;&emsp; [🕸Convoluted Neural Networks CNN Implementation Using Keras](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Convoluted-Neural-Networks-CNN-Implementation-Using-Keras/blob/master/CNN_MNIST.ipynb) - This is a simple project to implement Convolutional Neural Network and note its working. Different layer sizes and different kernels are chosen and trained on a simple dataset. The data that was taken was MNIST that is available in Kaggle. There are different kernel sizes considered and outputs are noted using a graph respectively. By doing this project, I've learned to use Keras and Tensorflow for building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) respectively. 

## Data Visualization Projects 
It is important to note that data visualization is the key to extract insights from the data. In addition to this, it also gives us insights about whether new features must be created or removed. If we find that there is a strong correlation between different features, all those features can be removed (considering that the dimensionality of the data is very large). Therefore, we have to spend time in performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Below are some of the data visualization projects. 

&emsp;&emsp; [📽YouTube Video Analysis](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis/blob/main/Youtube%20Video%20Analysis%20Python.ipynb) - Since there are many videos being uploaded everyday, it is important to analyze the videos and the categories. In the project, we have also analyzed the likes, comments and other important features when videos are being uploaded. Various plots were used in the process of exploring the data such as Scatterplots and Countplots. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🔍Google Play store genre prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Google-Play-Store-Genre-Prediction) - In this analysis, we are going to understand the different type of apps in Google Play store. In addition, we are also going to understand the NULL values that are present in our data. Moreover, we are going to analyse the total number of apps that are paid and free. We also would differentiate those apps based on age groups respectively.
