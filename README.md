## 📔📓My Inspiration😀😀:

![](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/kristopher-roller-PC_lbSSxCZE-unsplash.jpg)
My interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence started when I was in my final year pursuing a Bachelor of Technology. I remember that we had to pick a final year project. During that time, I could see that machine learning and artificial intelligence were talked about most on the internet, and it's potential to revolutionize people's lives. I suggested to my teammates that using machine learning for healthcare is a really good practice. Me and my teammates worked using Machine Learning to predict the chances of a person to suffer from Heart Disease respectively. The challenge with diagnosing whether a person would suffer from heart disease using traditional methods is that they are often slow and require a lot of time and effort from the doctors. Therefore, we looked for various ways in which we would automate the process. We were able to download the dataset from Kaggle and implement the machine learning models for predictions for the heart disease dataset. We were able to get good results on the test set. I could see how machine learning was used for diagnosing whether a person would suffer from heart disease. It spiked an interest where I tried to look for ways in which I could apply machine learning. I came across Kaggle - a website that allows people to download datasets for machine learning and artificial intelligence purposes. I applied my knowledge of machine learning and data science in different domains such as healthcare, academia, and retail industries😀😀.

It is with my interest and passion for the field that I started to apply my knowledge of Machine Learning in different projects. I've gone through some of the courses that are in demand in the field of Machine Learning such as "Machine Learning" and "Deep Learning Specialization" both by Andrew Ng. Below are the links to some of my projects on Data Science. Some of the projects present involve performing data analysis and data visualization which are important to get insights.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand various important features in the data. The notebooks have been split where one is for EDA while the other is for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Predictions respectively.

## 🗣📣 My Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is converting a natural text into a form that could be used for machine learning and deep learning purposes. It involves extracting texts, removing stopwords, lemmatization and stemming, lowercasing the letters, and removing punctuations and other text information that do not add a lot of meaning in our machine learning predictions. Below are the links to some of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.

![](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/roman-kraft-X1exjxxBho4-unsplash.jpg)

&emsp;&emsp; [📚Predicting Readability of Texts Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Predicting-Readability-of-Texts-Using-Machine-Learning) - Since there is a lot of text around us, it would be beneficial if we get to know the content. In addition to this, understanding the difficulty of the text and whether it is at our level could give us good knowledge about the depth of the article. Moreover, libraries and other educational institutions could use this information and classify textbooks and notebooks, and separate them based on the difficulty level. In this project, machine learning and deep learning algorithms were used to predict the difficulty of texts. Hyperparameter tuning was also done to ensure that the models took important features into consideration and made predictions with low mean squared error and mean absolute error respectively.

&emsp;&emsp; [👹Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis) - In Twitter, there are comments made for different posts and tweets. Sometimes, there might be negative comments that would change the course of direction of certain topics. It is important to identify comments and extract key features from the text so that positive and negative comments could be separated. In this project, we are going to be extracting useful information from texts and understand key components for differentiating between positive texts and negative texts.

## 👀👁 My Computer Vision Projects

![](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/GIF-files/blob/main/Robot%20Computer%20Vision.gif)

Computer Vision is a subset of artificial intelligence which gives the computer to perform computations and make predictions on image data. If the image of a cat is given, for instance, the computer vision algorithms would classify whether there is a cat in the image based on a previously labeled set of images. Therefore, it is important to give the right data to the computer vision algorithms in order for them to get the right predictions. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🥄Steel Defect Detection](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Steel-Defect-Detection-Challenge) - There are many steel manufacturing industries that produce large quantities of steel. There might be instances where there are defects that go unnoticed. These defects can lead to a reduction in the quality of steel respectively. Moreover, This could lead to problems such as corrosion and other errors. Since it takes a lot of time for people to detect the defects in steel, proper analysis and prediction mechanisms must be undertaken. Predictions can be generated by the Convoluted Neural Networks (CNNs) based on the past training examples. Therefore, this would save a lot of time and effort by companies when they deploy machine learning models in predicting the damage present in the steel. We would use deep learning models in predicting the defects in steel respectively.

&emsp;&emsp; [🕸Convoluted Neural Networks CNN Implementation Using Keras](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Convoluted-Neural-Networks-CNN-Implementation-Using-Keras) - This is a simple project to implement Convolutional Neural Network and note its working. Different layer sizes and different kernels are chosen and trained on a simple dataset. The data that was taken was MNIST that is available in Kaggle. There are different kernel sizes considered and outputs are noted using a graph respectively. By doing this project, I've learned to use Keras and Tensorflow for building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) respectively.

&emsp;&emsp; 🌾[Wheat Detection Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Wheat-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision) - There are a lot of food products that we get from wheat. Wheat is known as the common food staple that could be used to prepare different kinds of food items. Since there are differnet types of wheat available, it is important to identify different kinds of wheat available. In the machine learning project, images of different kinds of wheat heads are taken and made available so that computer vision could be used to understand the wheat heads and distinguish them. Various computer vision algorithms are used to identify the wheat heads respectively. 

## 📊🗺 My Data Visualization Projects 

![](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/luke-chesser-JKUTrJ4vK00-unsplash.jpg)

It is important to note that data visualization is the key to extract insights from the data. In addition to this, it also gives us insights into whether new features must be created or removed. If we find that there is a strong correlation between different features, all those features can be removed (considering that the dimensionality of the data is very large). Therefore, we have to spend time in performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Below are some of the data visualization projects.

&emsp;&emsp; [📽YouTube Video Analysis](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Youtube-Video-Analysis) - Since there are many videos being uploaded every day, it is important to analyze the videos and the categories. In the project, we have also analyzed the likes, comments, and other important features when videos are being uploaded. Various plots were used in the process of exploring the data such as Scatterplots and Countplots.

&emsp;&emsp; [🔍Google Play store Genre Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Google-Play-Store-Genre-Prediction) - In this analysis, we are going to understand the different types of apps in the Google Play store.
