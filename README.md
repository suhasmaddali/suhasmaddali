### Hi there 👋

I'm really passionate about Machine Learning and Data Science. With the development of technology, I believe that there is a huge potential for Artificial Intelligence in different domains. The rapid rate at which there is advancement in Computing power and the freedom to take a large amount of data really pushes the field of Data Science and Machine Learning to a whole new level. 

It is with my interest and passion towards the field that I started to apply my knowledge of Machine Learning in different projects. I've gone through some of the courses that are in demand in the field of Machine Learning such as "Machine Learning" and "Deep Learning Specialization" both by Andrew Ng. Below are the links to some of my projects on Data Science. Some of the projects present involve performing data analysis and data visualization which are important to get insights. 

🔭 I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Some of them involve Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. 

🌱 Below are the links to my projects on GitHub. 

## Machine Learning Projects 

&emsp;&emsp; [🚴‍♂️Washington Bike Demand Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Washington-Bike-Demand-Prediction) - In this project, the demand for rental             bikes was predicted using different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Moreover, some of the useful features were visualized. Dependencies between features were highlighted and correlation matrix was plotted to get an understanding of the relationship betweep features.

&emsp;&emsp; [🚙Car Prices Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Car-Prices-Prediction) - In this machine learning project, the prices of cars would be predicted based on features such as horsepower (HP), Mileage, Make and other features. Most of the project contains visualizations followed by machine learning and deep learning algorithm predictions. 

&emsp;&emsp; [🏦Predicting Loan Default Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Predicting-Loan-Default-Using-Machine-Learning) - It is important for banks to give loans to customers based on whether they would be able to repay the loan or not. Sometimes, banks end up giving loans to people and end up not getting paid back the money along with interest. Machine Learning could be used in order to determine whether loan must be given to a person, and this would help the financial institutions and banks in saving money respectively. 

&emsp;&emsp; [👨‍⚕️Cancer Diagnosis Prediction](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Cancer-Diagnosis-Prediction) - Cancer is a life-threatening disease, and it is really important to take the right steps in order to prevent this disease. Machine Learning and Data Science could be used to uncover key insights in data about Cancer and they could aid Doctors in predicting the chances of cancer. In this project, the chances of occurrence of cancer belonging to 9 classes is predicted using Machine Learning. Since there are more than 2 classes, it is a multi-class classification problem. 

&emsp;&emsp;[🧡Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning](https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Heart-Disease-Prediction) - There are features that are important to predict heart disease in a patient such as Blood Pressure (BP), BMI and other factors. Since doctors cannot take into account all the factors and suggest whether a person may or may not have a heart disease, it is time to use the machine learning and deep learning algorithms to the rescue. In this machine learning project, various features such as BMI, Cholestrol and other factors are considered for predicting the chances of a person to suffer from a heart disease. Various machine learning models were used for the predictions and their precision, recall and accuracy were plotted respectively.
